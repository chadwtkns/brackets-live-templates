brackets-live-templates
=======================

Brackets Live Templates is a test repo that I am trying out to create a plugin for Brackets. The plugin is an attempt to create shortcuts for code. Example: type "f" in a javascript file then hit tab and writes the code "function(){}" for you. 

(write now im just figuring out the readme.)
